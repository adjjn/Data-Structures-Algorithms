# Data-Structures-Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that deal with organizing and processing data efficiently. 

Here's a brief overview:


Data Structures:

Arrays: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.

Linked Lists: A sequence of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.

Stacks: A Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure where elements are added and removed from the same end.

Queues: A First In, First Out (FIFO) structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Trees: Hierarchical structures with nodes and edges, commonly used in representing hierarchical data.

Graphs: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes.

Hash Tables: Data structures that store key-value pairs and provide efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval.



Algorithms:

Searching Algorithms: Techniques for finding an element within a collection.

Linear Search

Binary Search

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Sorting Algorithms: Techniques for arranging elements in a specific order.

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Graph Algorithms: Algorithms to traverse or manipulate graphs.

Dijkstra's Algorithm

Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm

Prim's Algorithm

Dynamic Programming: Technique to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

Recursion: A function that calls itself directly or indirectly.

Greedy Algorithms: Algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.


These concepts are crucial for designing efficient algorithms and building robust software systems. Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for solving complex problems in various domains, including software development, artificial intelligence, and computational biology.
